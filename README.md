# AI/ML Template

## Introduction

This is a template repository for AI/ML application development and research. The goal of this template is to provide commonly used packages with reproducible environments with proper dependency environment and multi-platform support.

## Tackling Environment Complexity

I am using Conda and Poetry together to tackle the task of managing a complex AI/ML environment. Conda is used to create isolated environments while Poetry is used to manage packages and ensure dependency resolution ([article](https://medium.com/@silvinohenriqueteixeiramalta/conda-and-poetry-a-harmonious-fusion-8116895b6380#:~:text=Conda%20and%20Poetry%20are%20well,package%20management%20and%20dependency%20resolution.)).

## Tackling Command Line Complexity

I am using a Makefile to automate shell commands to create and build the conda environment and run test files. I am creating this Makefile from scratch using this [article](https://medium.com/@silvinohenriqueteixeiramalta/conda-and-poetry-a-harmonious-fusion-8116895b6380#:~:text=Conda%20and%20Poetry%20are%20well,package%20management%20and%20dependency%20resolution.).
